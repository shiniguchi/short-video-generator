# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Reliably produce publish-ready short-form videos from a theme/product input — full pipeline from trend analysis through composition — without manual intervention between stages.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation & Infrastructure)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Completed plan 01-02 (PostgreSQL schema and async models)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2 min), 01-02 (2 min)
- Trend: Steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stable Video Diffusion for prototype (local, free, swappable to Veo/Sora)
- Google Sheets with local fallback (build full integration, use sample data until service account configured)
- 6 microservices architecture (each maps to future Cloud Run service)
- Celery + Redis for task queue (standard Python async task processing)
- [Phase 01]: Use expire_on_commit=False in async SQLAlchemy session factory to prevent implicit queries
- [Phase 01]: Use JSON columns for flexible metadata storage in pipeline entities

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (Trend Intelligence):**
- TikTok API access requires developer account approval with unclear criteria
- Google Sheets API quota (60 requests/minute/user) needs validation during sync implementation

**Phase 3 (Content Generation):**
- Stable Video Diffusion production experience limited — plan for quality validation during implementation
- Temporal drift in AI video beyond 2-3 seconds — architecture designed for short clips (2-4s) to mitigate

**Phase 6 (Pipeline Integration):**
- Cloud Run GPU support limitation — video-generator service may need GCE/GKE deployment or cloud-only APIs (Veo/Sora)
